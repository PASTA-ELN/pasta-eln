  A metaclass that implements the Singleton design pattern.

  Explanation:
      This metaclass ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
      When a class is created using this metaclass, it checks if an instance already exists; if not, it creates one.

  Returns:
      The single instance of the class.

    Creates or retrieves the singleton instance of the class.

    Explanation:
        This method is called when an instance of the class is requested.
        It checks if an instance already exists; if not, it creates a new instance and stores it for future requests.

    Args:
        *args (Any): Variable length argument list for the class constructor.

  Singleton class for managing QTA icons.

      This class ensures that there is only one instance of QTAIconsSingleton throughout the application.

  Attributes:
      logger (logging.Logger): Logger for the class.
      _icon_names (dict[str, list[str]]): Dictionary to store icon names categorized by font collections.
      _font_collections (list[str]): List of font collections used for icons.
      _icons_initialized (bool): Flag indicating whether the icons have been initialized.

  Methods:
      set_icon_names(): Initializes the icon names based on the available font collections.
