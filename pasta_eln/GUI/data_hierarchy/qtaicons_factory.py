class QTAIconsFactory:
  """
  Singleton class for managing QTA icons.

  This class ensures that there is only one instance of QTAIconsFactory throughout the application. It initializes and manages icon names and font collections for use in the UI.

  Attributes:
      logger (logging.Logger): Logger for the class.
      _icon_names (dict[str, list[str]]): Dictionary to store icon names categorized by font collections.
      _font_collections (list[str]): List of font collections used for icons.
      _icons_initialized (bool): Flag indicating whether the icons have been initialized.

  Methods:
      get_instance(): Returns the singleton instance of the class.
      set_icon_names(): Initializes the icon names based on the available font collections.
      font_collections: Property to get or set the font collections.
      icon_names: Property to get or set the icon names.

    Returns the singleton instance of the class. This method ensures that only one instance of the class is created and returned.

    This class method checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it in a class attribute. Subsequent calls to this method will return the existing instance.

    Args:
        cls: The class itself.

    Returns:
        An instance of the class.

    Examples:
        instance1 = YourClassName.get_instance()
        instance2 = YourClassName.get_instance()
        assert instance1 is instance2  # Both calls return the same instance.
