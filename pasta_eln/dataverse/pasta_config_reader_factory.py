class PastaConfigReaderFactory:
  """
  PastaConfigReaderFactory is a singleton class responsible for managing the configuration of the application.

  This class provides methods to read, update, and delete the configuration,
  as well as to monitor changes to the configuration file. It ensures that only one instance of the
  class exists and handles thread safety for configuration access.

  Attributes:
      _instance (Any): The singleton instance of the class.
      logger (Logger): Logger for logging configuration actions.
      config_file_name (str): The path to the configuration file.
      config (dict[str, Any]): The current configuration dictionary.
      mutex (Lock): A mutex for thread-safe access to the configuration.
      fs_watcher (QFileSystemWatcher): A file system watcher to monitor changes to the configuration file.

  Methods:
      get_instance: Retrieve the singleton instance of the class.
      __init__: Initialize the PastaConfigReaderFactory instance.
      read_pasta_config: Read the configuration file and update the internal configuration.
      config_file_changed: Handle changes to the configuration file.
      config: Property to get, set, and delete the current configuration.
  Note:
      This class is a singleton. It ensures that only one instance of the class exists.
      Make sure to use the get_instance() method to retrieve the singleton instance.
      Make sure that this class is initialized only after the instantiation of QApplication.instance() in-order to
        ensure that the file system watcher is properly set up and the signal-slot connections works as expected.
