"""extract data from vendor
- comma and semicolon separated table

THIS IS THE BASIC EXTRACTOR TUTORIAL, WHICH TEACHES
- how to use style recipes:
  - in the code these are lines which have an if-statement and this is followed by a comment "#:" which is then used for the human readable part
  - the default case is with "elif True and" which is a little strange but follows above rule of if-statement and ....
  - please use this way of writing code and the extractors should work
- how to create metadata conveniently using "Long name [Unit]" nomenclature
- how to create images
