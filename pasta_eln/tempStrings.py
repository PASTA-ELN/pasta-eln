<h3>Very important show stopper</h3>
<ul>
<li> move own research
<li> selection does not scroll; one cannot select a row
</ul>

<h3>To be verified</h3>
<ul>
<li> be sure that no restart is required
<li> execute restart here via comm to gui.py
<li> fix numpy, scipy, lmfit, ... versions
</ul>

<h3>Small things implemented next</h3>
<ul>
<li> drag drop external files
<li> go to positional arguments only: no -i ....
<li> invert filter: not t in name

</ul>

<h3>Bigger things implemented soon</h3>
<ul>
<li> Basic functionality for V1
<li> after save: information should be integrated into ontology; and then the views have to be rebuild
<li> change docID after docType change
<li> into config file
<li> make sure these make sense
<li> requires view to change to
<li> to config
<li> unprocessed files should be have separate docType
<li> what if names are identical

<h3>Things worthwile remembering</h3>
<ul>
<li> add keyboard shortcut to test this extractor
<li> config
<li> do we still need curate, what is the replacement?
<li> if successful in Aug2023: remove "echo....read"
<li> not always perfect: use regex
<li> possible test that parent has corresponding show
<li> rerun extractors as batch
<li> this should become a GUI and CLI and separate into three-files: functions, CLI, GUI
</ul>
