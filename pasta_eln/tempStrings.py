<h3>Very important show stopper</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Things currently working on</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Improvement to convenience</h3>
<ul>
<li> design ProjectView: Currently, the comment is more highlighted than the title of an item due
<li> design: make the checkboxes larger!
<li> export: export via extractor in high resolution: change order: first save, then rescale
<li> extractor: creates links to sample/instrument
<li> finish ontology dialog
<li> form: add button to add key-values
<li> image does not allow for easy context aware clicks
<li> other items as non-edible things that can be copy-pasted
<li> projectTree design: If folders and other items have boxes of slightly different brightness
<li> projectView: if table-row click, move to view it project
<li> projectView: selection does not scroll; one cannot select a row
<li> table: shift-select
<li> tableHeaderChange: requires view to change to views, not ontology
</ul>

<h3>Bigger things implemented soon</h3>
<ul>
<li> add splitter to increase / decrease image
<li> addToConfig
<li> can you sort for true false in tables too?
<li> change to string-output
<li> configuration
<li> from config file
<li> not sure this will be important
<li> projectTree: allow right click on measurement to change recipe
<li> projectTree: drag&drop of external files
<li> projectTree: select multiple items to edit... What is use case
</ul>

<h3>Things worthwile remembering/uncritical</h3>
<ul>
<li> allow to add more users and each user can have multiple organizations
<li> copy of file: should it the be the same in database or should it be two separate entities??
<li> create list of unaccessible files: linked with accessible files
<li> for now, sorted by last change of project itself: future create a view that does that automatically
<li> if successful in Aug2023: remove "echo....read"
<li> invert filter: not 'Sur' in name => '^((?!Sur).)*$' in name
<li> moreChecksDB: if parent has corresponding show
<li> only write markdown files for now
<li> remove this warning
<li> serverConfiguration: this should become a GUI and CLI and separate into three-files: functions, CLI, GUI
<li> this childNumSearch could become new function
</ul>
