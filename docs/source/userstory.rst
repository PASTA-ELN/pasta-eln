Planning-Based Research
-----------------------

**Andrew's Scenario**: Andrew, a researcher, utilizes the PASTA-ELN platform to plan and execute his research projects. To achieve this, he follows a structured approach:

*   In the project view of PASTA-ELN, Andrew outlines the steps necessary to reach his research objective and breaks them down into smaller sub-steps, depending on the required level of detail. For each task added to the project view, a corresponding folder is automatically created within the root project directory. As a result, the project hierarchy in PASTA-ELN is reflected in the folders on the harddisk of Andrew's computer.
*   When executing tasks, Andrew collects relevant data, which is then associated with the corresponding task in his project. To manage data files within PASTA-ELN, Andrew moves or copies them into the respective folder on the harddisk and then scan the project hierarchy to have the metadata automatically extracted by the add-on programs.
*   To document the samples or instruments used to complete certain tasks, Andrew can link existing sample or instrument items to the measurement entries in the project view. He also utilizes the "Procedures" category to organize experimental workflows and link them to executed tasks or subtasks. Additionally, metadata that requires manual entry, such as Andrew's notes on results quality or experimental process, can be added in the comment section of a task itself or the attached data file.

This approach enables Andrew to maintain a planning-based project structure and keep track of the steps required to reach his research objective, as well as the corresponding data entries.

Importing Previous Data
-----------------------

**Brenda's Scenario**: Brenda, a researcher with existing data from previous projects, aims to integrate this data into PASTA-ELN in a convenient manner.

*   Brenda's data is already structured according to her preferences
*   To integrate the existing data into PASTA-ELN, Brenda creates a project and then copies or moves her folders and data files into the project directory. The addons extract the required metadata is retrieved from the data files. After scanning the project hierarchy, Brenda's data and metadata are automatically added to the project, preserving the existing folder structure.
*   Following the integration of the entire data collection, Brenda can manually fill in additional metadata, comments, and links to other items, such as samples or procedures.

This workflow showcases the adaptability of PASTA-ELN in integrating and managing large amounts of data with minimal input required from the user.

Recording Meeting Notes
-----------------------

**Claire's Scenario**: Claire, a researcher who frequently attends conferences and meetings, aims to structure her notes using PASTA-ELN.

*   Claire can create an arbitrary structure within a project and record her notes as comments to each item in Markdown format. The comments are then formatted and displayed immediately for each item created in the project view, providing a clear overview of the notes.
*   The notes in comments can be linked to data files, which can be attached by copying or moving to the respective folder.

The Markdown comment tool provides a versatile and user-friendly way to create and structure notes.
