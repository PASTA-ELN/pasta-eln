Extractors
**********

This page should become an overview on extractors. Those are little python programs that 'extract' metadata, thumbnails and user-metadata from the raw files. These little programs can be written/adopted by scientists and can be shared.

General information on file formats can be found:

Unidentified files can be changed via the GUI.
