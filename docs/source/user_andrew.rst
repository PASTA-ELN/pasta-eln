User Story Andrew

Planning-Based Research
-----------------------

**Andrew's Scenario**: Andrew, a researcher, utilizes the PASTA-ELN platform to plan and execute his research projects. To achieve this, he follows a structured approach:

*   In the project view of PASTA-ELN, Andrew outlines the steps necessary to reach his research objective and breaks them down into smaller sub-steps, depending on the required level of detail. For each task added to the project view, a corresponding folder is automatically created within the root project directory. As a result, the project hierarchy in PASTA-ELN is reflected in the folders on the harddisk of Andrew's computer.
*   When executing tasks, Andrew collects relevant data, which is then associated with the corresponding task in his project. To manage data files within PASTA-ELN, Andrew moves or copies them into the respective folder on the harddisk and then scan the project hierarchy to have the metadata automatically extracted by the add-on programs.
*   To document the samples or instruments used to complete certain tasks, Andrew can link existing sample or instrument items to the measurement entries in the project view. He also utilizes the "Procedures" category to organize experimental workflows and link them to executed tasks or subtasks. Additionally, metadata that requires manual entry, such as Andrew's notes on results quality or experimental process, can be added in the comment section of a task itself or the attached data file.

This approach enables Andrew to maintain a planning-based project structure and keep track of the steps required to reach his research objective, as well as the corresponding data entries.
