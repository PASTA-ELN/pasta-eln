Recording Meeting Notes
-----------------------

**Claire's Scenario**: Claire, a researcher who frequently attends conferences and meetings, aims to structure her notes using PASTA-ELN.

*   Claire can create an arbitrary structure within a project and record her notes as comments to each item in Markdown format. The comments are then formatted and displayed immediately for each item created in the project view, providing a clear overview of the notes.
*   The notes in comments can be linked to data files, which can be attached by copying or moving to the respective folder.

The Markdown comment tool provides a versatile and user-friendly way to create and structure notes.
