*****************

Importing Previous Data
-----------------------

**Brenda's Scenario**: Brenda, a researcher with existing data from previous projects, aims to integrate this data into PASTA-ELN in a convenient manner.

*   Brenda's data is already structured according to her preferences
*   To integrate the existing data into PASTA-ELN, Brenda creates a project and then copies or moves her folders and data files into the project directory. The addons extract the required metadata is retrieved from the data files. After scanning the project hierarchy, Brenda's data and metadata are automatically added to the project, preserving the existing folder structure.
*   Following the integration of the entire data collection, Brenda can manually fill in additional metadata, comments, and links to other items, such as samples or procedures.

This workflow showcases the adaptability of PASTA-ELN in integrating and managing large amounts of data with minimal input required from the user.
