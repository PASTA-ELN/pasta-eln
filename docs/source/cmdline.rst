Command line reference
----------------------

This module reference extends the manual with an overview of the
available functionality built into datalad gooey.
Please note that apart from the main command, the commands this module provides are internal helpers used within DataLad Gooey for fast annotations and file tree overviews.
Unlike the DataLad core package or its extensions, the commands provided by DataLad Gooey are thus not intended to be used directly.
