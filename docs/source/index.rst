PASTA electronic lab notebook (ELN) | The favorite ELN for experimental scientists
**********************************************************************************

PASTA-ELN makes it easy and convenient for experimental scientist to organize raw-data with metadata. Extractors automatically enter metadata and images into the database. Every researcher can fully adapt the metadata definitions to the personal taste and create an arbitrary folder structure. PASTA-ELN uses a local-first approach store all data and metadata locally (always accessible to user by the conventional software) and synchronize with a server upon user request.

Three (fictitious) user stories highlight different methods of using PASTA-ELN:

- Andrew plans his research first and then executes the tasks. :ref:`Read on how you can follow this path.. <Planning based research>`.
- Brenda has lots of data from her previous research in different folders and wants to integrate that data conveniently. :ref:`Read on how you can follow this path.. <Importing previous data>`.
- Claire goes to many conferences and meetings and wants to structure her notes. :ref:`Read on how you can follow this path.. <Recording meeting notes>`.

Additionally, PASTA-ELN supports the user in following good research data guidelines, :ref:`which are given ... <dodonts>`.

If you want to know more about the motivation for creating PASTA, :ref:`an overview is given <motivation>`. Questions are answered in the :ref:`FAQs <faqs>`. If you want to contribute to the development, please visit us on `github.com <https://github.com/PASTA-ELN/pasta-eln>`_.
