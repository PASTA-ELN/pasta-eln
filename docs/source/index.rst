**User-Centered Approaches**: Three distinct user stories illustrate the versatility of PASTA-ELN:

1.  **Planning-Based Research**: Andrew's approach involves planning his research and then executing tasks. Learn more about how to follow this path by consulting the :ref:`Planning Based Research <Planning-Based Research>` section.
2.  **Importing Previous Data**: Brenda's workflow involves integrating data from previous research projects. Discover how to import and consolidate your existing data by reading the :ref:`Importing Previous Data <Importing previous data>` section.
3.  **Recording Meeting Notes**: Claire's workflow focuses on structuring meeting notes and conference materials. Find out how to capture and organize your meeting notes by consulting the :ref:`Recording Meeting Notes <Recording meeting notes>` section.

**Local-First Approach**: PASTA-ELN employs a local-first approach, storing all data and metadata on the user's storage device and synchronizing it with a server upon request. This ensures that data remains accessible through conventional software and maintains its security and confidentiality. Additionally, researchers can customize metadata definitions and create arbitrary folder structures to accommodate their unique workflows and research objectives. This flexibility allows users to easily transfer their data to other computers, collaborators, institutions, or archives by zipping the contents of their hard disk.
