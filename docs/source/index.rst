**User-Centered Approaches**: Three distinct user stories illustrate the versatility of PASTA-ELN:

**Local-First Approach**: PASTA-ELN employs a local-first approach, storing all data and metadata on the user's storage device and synchronizing it with a server upon request. This ensures that data remains accessible through conventional software and maintains its security and confidentiality. Additionally, researchers can customize metadata definitions and create arbitrary folder structures to accommodate their unique workflows and research objectives. This flexibility allows users to easily transfer their data to other computers, collaborators, institutions, or archives by zipping the contents of their hard disk.
