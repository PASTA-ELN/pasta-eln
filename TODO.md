# Priority 1
- Fast changes on GUI: Try
  - implement refreshAll
    - restart backend does not work, or requires gui-restart
  - Technologies
    - scroll-area
    - tree-view with widgets leafs

- Slow things that need more time

# Priority 2
- have discussion with Georg, KIT
- (HT) replace documentation
- reduce self.
- rename into pasta: backend., be. into pasta.!!

# Priority 3
- Perhaps: fixed version number gitannex and datalad
- move tests to new version
- setup.cfg: pytest
- Windows/Anaconda generally works, use Marble documentation if it fully works. Git/Git-annex/datalad do not work currently
  - Datalad documentation has the following suggestion for git-installation
    - Enable Use a TrueType font in all console windows  (I cannot find)
    - Select Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software (default on page ~6)
    - Enable file system caching (page 12)
    - Enable symbolic links (page 12)
