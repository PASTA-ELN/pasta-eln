# PASTA electronic lab notebook (ELN) | The favorite ELN for experimental scientists

Pasta-dishes are a mixture pasta and sauce, the latter adds flavors and richness to the otherwise boring pasta. This ELN combines raw-data with rich metadata to allow advanced data science. In the database, one can fully adapt and improvise the metadata definitions to generate something novel. PASTA-ELN uses a local-first approach: store all data and metadata locally (always accessible to user) and synchronize with a server upon user request.
